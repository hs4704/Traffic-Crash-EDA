# Traffic-Crash-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on traffic crash data to understand patterns in accidents 

# Overview:
In this project, I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on traffic crash dataset ('https://storage.googleapis.com/assignment-data/Traffic_Crashes.csv'). This Dataset includes information about location,date,time,environmental conditions, injuries and other factors that might have caused the accidents. Using Python and libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, I cleaned and analyzed the data to uncover patterns and trends that could be used to create better traffic safety procedures. 

# Key Steps: 
Data Cleaning: Performed cleaning methods such as deleting or altering missing values or data inconsistencies. Formatted columns to be uniform for analysis. 
Data Visualiztion: Created multiple plots to visualize the relationships betweeen location, time, weather/road conditions and severity of crashes. 
Insights: Analyzed the plots and trends to see what influences the likelihood of a accident.
