# 🚗 Traffic Crash EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on traffic crash data to uncover patterns and inform safety improvements.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a traffic crash dataset, available at:  
`Traffic_Crashes.csv`

The dataset contains detailed records of traffic crashes, including:

- Location  
- Date and time  
- Environmental conditions  
- Injury counts  
- Contributing factors  

Using Python and key data science libraries—Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib—I cleaned and explored the data to identify trends that may help improve traffic safety measures.

## 🔧 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values and inconsistencies  
- Standardized date/time formats and categorical fields  
- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns  

### 2. Data Visualization

Created insightful plots to explore relationships between:

- Crash frequency and location  
- Time of day and day of week  
- Weather and road conditions  
- Severity of crashes  

### 3. Insights

- Identified high-risk time windows and locations  
- Noted environmental factors that correlate with crash severity  
- Recognized patterns in crashes involving injuries
